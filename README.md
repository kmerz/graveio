# graveio - where your code stays alive

graveio is a attemp to provide a simple, easy to use and install paste bin
solution for inhouse use.

It was developed with *ruby 1.9.3p0* and *rails 3.2*.

For install:
-  clone this repository
-  install ruby 1.9
-  call `bunlde install` inside of repository
-  call `rake db:create && rake db:migrate`

Lunch:
-  `rails s production`

For easier posting of content to graveio, you can use bury, a ruby command line
tool which also integrates to vim. You can find it in bin/bury.

At this state of developement take a look for a help at rails guides site.
